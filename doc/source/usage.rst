Usage

Backend Provider Detection
--------------------------

The ``--provider`` argument to ``os-net-config`` selects one of the available
backend providers:

- ``ifcfg`` Configure network interfaces using the ifcfg format
  ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`` files.
- ``eni`` Configure network interfaces using the Debian/Ubuntu
  ``/etc/network/interfaces`` format
- ``iproute`` (Not implemented)

When the ``--provider`` argument is not specified when calling
``os-net-config`` the provider will be chosen using the following rules:

1) If path ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`` exists, use the ``ifcfg``
   provider.

2) Otherwise if path ``/etc/network/`` exists, use the ``eni`` provider.

In these rules, if a path is specified for ``--root-dir`` this will be
prepended to the checked paths before doing the above tests.

Interface Mapping
-----------------

The file ``/etc/os-net-config/mapping.yaml`` can contain mappings from
interface identifiers to the actual interface names. A different mapping file can
be used by using the ``--mapping-file`` argument to ``os-net-config``.

This mapping allows consistent interface identifiers to be used in the config
without needing the full interface name which can vary across servers and
hardware changes. This also allows config to be performed for interfaces
which are in a ``DOWN`` state before configuration.

The format of the mapping.yaml is as follows:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    interface_mapping:
      nic1: enp0s20f0u2u1u2
      nic2: enp0s31f6

To assist in writing this file, the following command will generate a JSON
snippet with discovered interfaces::

    $ os-net-config --interfaces
    {'nic1': 'enp0s20f0u2u1u2', 'nic2': 'enp0s31f6'}

When the ``--persist-mapping`` argument is specified when calling
``os-net-config`` then the existing interfaces names will be permanently
renamed to their identifier name.

Network Configuration
---------------------

By default the file ``/etc/os-net-config/config.yaml`` will be sourced for
the network configuration, but an alternate file can be used with the
``--config-file`` argument. The following arguments change the behaviour
during configuration:

- ``--detailed-exit-codes`` If enabled an exit code of ``FILES_CHANGED`` (2) means that
  files were modified.
- ``--exit-on-validation-errors`` Exit with an error if configuration
  file validation fails.
- ``--noop`` Return the configuration commands, without applying them.
- ``--no-activate`` Install the configuration but don't start/stop
  interfaces.
- ``--cleanup`` Cleanup unconfigured interfaces.

Python Library
--------------

To use os-net-config in a project::

	import os_net_config
